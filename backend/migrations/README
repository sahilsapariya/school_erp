Flask-Migrate (Alembic) migrations for School ERP.

Commands (run from project root with FLASK_APP=backend.app:app):

  flask db upgrade     Apply all pending migrations
  flask db downgrade   Revert one revision
  flask db migrate -m "message"   Generate a new migration from model changes
  flask db current     Show current revision
  flask db history     Show revision history

Legacy manual SQL scripts (add_student_phone.sql, add_student_fields.sql) are
kept for reference; schema is now managed by these migrations.
